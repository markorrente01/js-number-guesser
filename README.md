### What I learned

In this mini-project i learnt how to create a random numbers that i the developer can't even predict.

```js
function getRandomNum(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random()*(max-min)+min);
}
```
### Continued development

Will later recreate this with a better ui experience using react.js instead of pure vanilla js.
